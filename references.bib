	abstract = {Abstract
            Foraging strategies of nonbreeding seabirds attending colonies remain virtually unknown. Here we report the results of a satellite telemetry study of nonbreeding Buller's Albatrosses (Thalassarche bulleri) from the Snares island group south of New Zealand in 2000–2001. Two 6- to 7-year-old prebreeding birds dispersed to Tasmania, Australia, from late May until at least late July. Six older birds (five prebreeding birds, one former breeding adult) all adopted a dual strategy of short trips (mean duration 1.3 days, mean foraging range 129 km) and long trips to southern New Zealand (9.6 days, 871 km) or Tasmania (22.0 days, 1918 km). Time allocation to short trips increased with age and experience (both sexes) and nest-site attendance (males), and decreased during the guard (when the chick is attended) and late postguard (chick left unattended) stages (females). Up to the guard stage, most birds present at their colony on consecutive days foraged overnight (mean foraging range 101 km). Nonbreeding birds used the same foraging areas as breeding adults, but allocated more foraging time to short trips during the corresponding incubation period and early postguard stage, and to long trips during the guard stage. Results suggest that prebreeding birds explore foraging areas sequentially, and increase their time ashore by progressing from making only long trips, to introducing short overnight trips, to modifying the duration of and allocation between long and short trips. Changes in body mass recorded on Solander Island (160 km north of the Snares) show that experienced nonbreeding birds initiate long foraging trips to regain mass lost during short trips, and suggest that less frequent short trips (and hence fewer returns ashore) among inexperienced birds are related to less efficient foraging during long trips.},

@article{noauthor_comparison_nodate,
	title = {Comparison of methods for determining key marine areas from tracking data},
	abstract = {There is an urgent need to identify key marine areas for conservation, particularly in the high seas. A range of techniques have been applied to tracking data from higher predators, particularly seabirds and pinnipeds, to determine the areas of greatest use. This study compared three commonly used methods—kernel, first-passage time and state-space modelling—and a new approach, minimum displacement rate, for the analysis of data from the wandering albatross Diomedea exulans of Bird Island, South Georgia, tracked during the chick-rearing period. Applied to a single track, these four models identified similar marine areas as important. The greatest similarity in areas identified occurred when model assumptions were shared (such as slow speed indicating spatial preference) even when methods modelled these assumptions differently (e.g. Bayesian inference versus cumulative density surface). A gridded overlap approach applied to all tracks revealed core areas not apparent from results of any single analysis. The gridded approach also revealed spatial overlap between methods based on different assumptions (e.g. minimum displacement rate and kernel analysis) and between individuals. Although areas identified as important by kernel and first-passage time analysis of a single track were biased towards resting locations during darkness, this does not negate the requirement for their protection. Using the gridded overlap approach, two distinct core regions were identified for the wandering albatross; one close to the breeding colony and another 800 km to the North–West in the high seas. This convenient and pragmatic approach could be applied to large data sets and across species for the identification of a network of candidate marine protected areas in coastal and pelagic waters.}

@article{noauthor_food_nodate,

	abstract = {The diet of the Light-mantled Sooty Albatross Phoebetria palpebrata breeding at South Georgia is described on the basis of quantitative analysis of thirtyseven food samples from chicks and nine from adults. Squid and krill Euphausia superba were the main components by weight and by frequency of occurrence, although fish were also taken.

Identifiable fish were chiefly myctophids; measurable krill were mature individuals. Of the eleven species of squid recorded, the most important were Mesonychoteuthis sp A (by numbers) and ?Discoteuthis sp (by weight). These species are hardly taken at all by the other two squideating albatrosses at South Georgia. There are few detailed similarities between the squid taken by P. palpebrata at South Georgia and those recorded in an analysis of re- gurgitated pellets at Marion Island.

Frequency of feeding of chicks and observations of birds at sea suggest that P. palpebrata can forage more widely during the breeding season than Black-browed and Grey-headed Albatrosses. Ecological segregation from these is thought to be achieved by a combination of differences in foraging range and area and by differences in the detailed composition of the diet.}

	abstract = {Cephalopods play an important role in the diet of many predators of the Southern Ocean. We investigated the cephalopod component of the diet of the wandering albatross, during breeding at South Georgia, from 269 boluses containing more than 34,000 beaks (corresponding to 19,452 individual cephalopods), collected between 1989 and 1999, and assessed the inter-annual variability of the cephalopod species, the level of scavenging on cephalopods by wandering albatrosses and the relationships between cephalopod availability and wandering albatross breeding parameters (breeding period, breeding success, fledging period, fledging success, egg mass and chick mass). We also proposed possible foraging areas of wandering albatrosses based on the cephalopods eaten. The cephalopod component of the diet of wandering albatrosses was relatively stable over the 11 years of the study. By number of lower beaks, three species predominated in the cephalopod component of the diet: Kondakovia longimana (29.5\% of the total number of lower beaks; family Onychoteuthidae), Taonius sp. (20.4\%; family Cranchiidae) and Histioteuthis sp. B (19.5\%; family Histioteuthidae). K. longimana was consistently the predominant cephalopod species by mass in every year of the study (range 60.2–88.7\% of mass contribution to diet). A minimum estimate of 30\% of the number of cephalopods scavenged corresponded to 85\% of the total mass of the cephalopods that contributed to the diet. Wandering albatrosses fed consistently more on "Antarctic" cephalopods than on "sub-Antarctic" or "subtropical" cephalopods in all years of the study, suggesting that Antarctic waters are an important foraging area for wandering albatrosses. Although some significant correlations between cephalopod abundance and wandering albatross breeding parameters existed (e.g. correlation between Taonius sp. by number and fledging success), none included K. longimana. When comparing groups of variables (using canonical analysis), no correlations were found between the most important cephalopod species (by number and by mass), total mass of squid consumed, cephalopod diversity index (H) for each year, and wandering albatross breeding parameters. This may reflect the possibility that other components in the diet (e.g. fish and carrion) are more important or, more likely, that the consistency across years of the wandering albatross breeding performance indicates that it is well buffered against fluctuations in prey availability.}

	abstract = {Arctic charr is an especially attractive aquaculture species given that it features the desirable tissue traits of other salmonids and is bred and grown at inland freshwater tank farms year round. It is of interest to develop upper temperature tolerant (UTT) strains of Arctic charr to increase the robustness of the species in the face of climate change and to enable production in more southern regions. We used a genomics approach that takes advantage of the well-studied Atlantic salmon genome to identify genes that are associated with UTT in Arctic charr. Specifically, we conducted an acute temperature trial to identify temperature tolerant and intolerant Arctic charr individuals, which were subject to microarray and qPCR analysis to identify candidate UTT genes. These were compared with genes annotated in a quantitative trait locus (QTL) region that was previously identified as associated with UTT in rainbow trout and Arctic charr and that we sequenced in Atlantic salmon. Our results suggest that small heat shock proteins as well as HSP-90 genes are associated with UTT. Furthermore, hemoglobin expression was significantly downregulated in tolerant compared with intolerant fish. Finally, QTL analysis and expression profiling identified COUP-TFII as a candidate UTT gene, although its specific role is unclear given the identification of two transcripts, which appear to have different expression patterns. Our results highlight the importance of using more than one approach to identify candidate genes, particularly when examining a complicated trait such as UTT in a highly complex genome for which there is no reference genome.},

As computer-based research has increased in complexity, so have the challenges of ensuring that this research is reproducible. To address this challenge, we review the concept of the research compendium as a solution for providing a standard and easily recognisable way for organising the digital materials of a research project to enable other researchers to inspect, reproduce, and extend the research. We investigate how the structure and tooling of software packages of the R programming language are being used to produce research compendia in a variety of disciplines. We also describe how software engineering tools and services are being used by researchers to streamline working with research compendia. Using real-world examples, we show how researchers can improve the reproducibility of their work using research compendia based on R packages and related tools.},
